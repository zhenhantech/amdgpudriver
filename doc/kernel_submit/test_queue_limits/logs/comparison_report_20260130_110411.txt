Generated: Fri Jan 30 11:04:11 AM CST 2026

Test Configuration:
  - Software Queue Limit (per process): 1024
  - Hardware Queue Limit (MI308X): 32

Test Results:

Test: 16 Streams
  Expected:
    - Software Queues: 16
    - Hardware HQDs: 16
    - HQD Status: ✓ Sufficient (no sharing)

Test: 32 Streams
  Expected:
    - Software Queues: 32
    - Hardware HQDs: 32
    - HQD Status: ✓ Sufficient (no sharing)

Test: 64 Streams
  Expected:
    - Software Queues: 64
    - Hardware HQDs: 32
    - HQD Status: ⚠ Insufficient (sharing required)
    - Sharing Ratio: 2.00:1

Logs Location: /mnt/md0/zhehan/code/coderampup/private_github/amdgpudriver/doc/kernel_submit/test_queue_limits/logs

Key Findings:
  1. Each stream creates 1 independent AQL Queue
  2. AQL Queues have independent ring buffers and doorbells
  3. HQD sharing occurs when streams > 32
  4. In CPSCH mode, HQD allocation is dynamic (firmware-managed)
